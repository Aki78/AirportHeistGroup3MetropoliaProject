## Introduction
This document specifies the design for the gameplay of Airport Heist. The key developers are Aki Morooka, Khai cao, Kiana Aghajani and Francesco Natanni. The Purpose of Airport Heist is to produce a fun and interactive game, that satisfies the guidelines provided by software1.

## Vision
#### Backstory
You are a master thief, captured by the Finnish authorities on the minor charge of jaywalking.
They have no idea of your genius though and neglect to watch over you properly.
You make a daring, yet surprisingly easy escape from Jokela Prison and are now on the run! 
You need to get out of Finland A.S.A.P though as the finnish authorities will stop at nothing to bring you to justice. 

Due to your expert skills you are able to steal 10,000â‚¬ from the Alepa at Helsinki Airport. 
The police, however, have been alerted of your activities and are hot on your tail.
Time to make your next move before interpol gets you!

#### Setting
Airport Heist is set in present-day Europe.

#### Objective
Your mission is to get to your extraction team who are waiting at the destination airport so they can smuggle you out of the EU.

## Functional Requirements
### How the game works
Airport Heist is a single player game, where the main character aims to make it to the destination airport, before they are captured, their stamina runs out or money runs out.

#### Travel

The main character start in Helsinki, Finland and must end up in the destination airport provided by the game. Travel is possible with the purchase of flight tickets. Players are shown a list of countries which they can travel to.

#### Evading Capture

Players can see in which city interpol is and a list of airports interpol may be at next.
Interpol moves from airport to airport at random, whenever the player makes a decision in the game. 

#### Stamina

Stamina is a set amount of energy that the main character has for travelling. Each time the main character travels they use up stamina. Stamina does not regenerate, so you must make it to your final destination before it runs out completely.

#### Stealing

The main character starts the game with a set amount of money. If the player requires more money they need to heist. There is, however, a chance of getting caught. Players are informed of the odds of capture before they attempt a heist and can abort if they feel the risks are too great. Players have 5 attempts to steal. If they use all 5 attempts before escaping, they will be caught and the game is over.

### Project Diagram
This diagram shows how our different python files interact with each other. At the moment we are using Godot, a game engine, but in the future we will create our user interface through javascript.

## Quality Requirements
#### Preliminary Requirements
All helper functions created were ran through pytest to ensure proper working order.
The database was cut down, to remove a lot of unnecessary information and to make calling upon the database faster.

#### Final Requirements and Goals

    -create scoring system
    -save top 10 players in a database
    -visually pleasing user interface
    -smooth animated motion
    -short start-up time
    -30fps
    -no freezing
    -the game will be in real time, instead of turn-based
    -interpol will be trained with machine learning
    -server will be set up remotely so the game will be playable online for anyone, anywhere
